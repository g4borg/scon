Game Submodule
--------------

This is the submodule that is intended to make a higher level api for scon.
While scon.logs is dealing with the parsing itself, scon.game should offer tools to quickly understand common parts of the data.
This includes:
	- determining the user
	- creating base classes for different game modes

*This Level of the API is work in progress and atm. not usable in this package*
